<h1>Implementing a SOC and Honeypot in Azure</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
In this project I setup Azure Sentinel (SIEM) and connected it to a live virtual machine acting as a honey pot. I observed live attacks (RDP Brute Force) from all around the world. I used a custom PowerShell script to look up the attackers Geolocation information and plot it on the Azure Sentinel Map.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- Azure Virtual Machines </b>
- Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM) </b>
- Log Analytics </b> 


<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>



To begin, I created a virtual machine on Azure to be used as a honeypot.

I created a username and password, and a network group to allow all ports to access the VM, in order to be open to the public internet. 

I connected to my VM using RDP and disabled all firewalls.

I downloaded a Powershell script to use in Powershell ISE, which extracts RDP failed login logs from Windows Event Viewer and the attackerâ€™s GEO locations.

Logs are being exported to Log Analytics workspace on Microsoft Azure with the raw data organized with a custom query for readability



Using Microsoft Sentinel as my SIEM, I create a workbook for my world map.

This World Map shows where in the world attacks are coming from, according to the geo data from the logs.
